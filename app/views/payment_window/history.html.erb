    The following is a summary of the payment windows associated with this project.
    You can create a payment window, where users will be able to pay for their shares by depositing into
    your paypal account. You will also see a list of previous windows.
  </p>

  <p>
    You select a window close date, at which users must pay for their shares.
    If you close the window, their shares will be given to the users who were
    initially given outstanding shares in the queue.
    Once you close a window, and still have not fully funded your project, you
    can open another one until you exhaust the share queue.
    When you have reached the end of the share queue, you can then request that
    PMF buy the outstanding shares.
  </p>

    <li>There is an amount of <%= print_money @project.amount_payment_outstanding %> still outstanding.</li>
    <li>
      If there is still outstanding funds to be collected, and users requesting shares that were initially
      marked as outstanding, you can collect funding from these shares by creating a new payment window below.
    </li>
    <li>If there are no users left in the share queue, you must request that PMF buys out the outstanding shares.</li>
