  <strong>How PirateMyFilm Works</strong>

  <p>
    Producers list projects; specifying budget requirements and other details.
    The system automatically creates enough shares to fund the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    All shares are priced at $5. Members reserve shares without committing funds.
    When 100% of available shares have been reserved and the project has been given a
    'green light' a group debit occurs and shares are allocated to members -
    who become share holders - on a first come, first serve basis with the funds
    that have been collected transferred to a PMF approved Executive Producer who
    in turn makes the funds available to the producer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The producer may increase or decrease the number of shares on offer
    (the size of their budget) at any time before the group debit.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a producer increases or decreases the number of shares on offer
    (the size of their budget) before the group debit, the system automatically
    increases or decreases the shares on offer and delete shares that have been
    reserved by members when appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The producer may increase or decrease the percentage of ad revenues and/or
    fee they are awarding to themselves per project at any time before the group debit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The producer may increase or decrease the percentage of ad revenues they are
    sharing with share holders at any time before the group debit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any ad revenues that a producer does not award to themself or share holdes
    automatically goes toward the PMF Fund.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on membership levels; producers are limited in the number of
    projects they can list; and members are limited in the number of projects
    they can reserve shares in as well as the number of shares they can reserve
    in each project.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PMF Fund rates each project on a scale of 'A' to 'C - ' (and 'unrated')
    and only 'A' rated projects qualify for a 'green light' and group debit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PMF Fund reserves the right to reserve shares in any project.
